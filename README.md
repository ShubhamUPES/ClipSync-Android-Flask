# 🚀 ClipSync Android Flask Server — OSoC Contribution

This repo showcases my open source work for the [OSoC ClipSync project](https://github.com/upes-open/OSoC-2025-ClipSync) as part of the Open Source Open Community.

## ✨ My Contribution

- Developed the **Android Flask server** to enable secure, encrypted clipboard sync between PC and Android devices.
- Integrated **AES-256 encryption** and seamless clipboard updates using Termux API.
- Ensured smooth cross-device communication and tested the setup end-to-end using both my laptop and phone.

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools

- Python, Flask, pycryptodome
- Termux & termux-api (Android)
- curl (for testing)

## 🔑 What I Solved

- **Issue #4:** Built and documented the Android Flask server for encrypted clipboard sync.
- **Issue #1:** Interactive setup script to streamline config.json creation
